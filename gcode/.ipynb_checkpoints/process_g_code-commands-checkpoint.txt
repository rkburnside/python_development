Monkey around with GCode (especially from KISSlicer. Cura, Craftware and
Slic3r support not thoroughly tested) written by Lars Norpchen,
http://www.octopusmotor.com

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u original replacement, --replace original replacement
                        Replace a code with another code. Regex coding is
                        supported (^ for beginning of line, etc). Use ~ for
                        space. Can be used to comment out codes by adding a
                        ";" to the code.
  --version             show program's version number and exit

File input and output options:
  -i filename, --input filename
                        specify the input file to process
  -o filename, --output filename
                        specify the output file to generate. If not specified,
                        output will overwrite the input file when done.
  -umo, --ultimaker-out
                        Output Ultimaker G-Code (extrusion by volume)
  -umi, --ultimaker-in  Input file is Ultimaker G-Code (extrusion by volume)
  --split filename (line, layer, zheight, nth, or path) value
                        Split the file into a second file based on line
                        number, layer, height or path type. Nth is every N
                        layers.
  --inject filename (line, layer, zheight, nth, or path) value
                        Insert the file snippet based on line number, layer,
                        height or path type. Nth is every N layers. MUST use
                        relative E coordindates and disable destringing in
                        slicer
  --merge filename [additional files ...]
                        Merge the specified file(s). They will be interleaved
                        by layer, sorted based on Z height. MUST use relative
                        E coordindates and disable destringing in slicer app #
                        (you can add retraction commands using the --retract
                        option)
  --resume line, layer, or Zheight value
                        Resume an interrupted print from a given line, layer
                        or ZHeight. X, Y and Z positions will be set for you,
                        and you need to manually position the printer's Z
                        height before resuming. Line number is not recommended
                        as it is based on the input file, which may change
                        position in the output file based on other post
                        processing commands.

Fan and Temperature control options:
  -f multiplier, --fan multiplier
                        Multiply all fan speeds by this. This only affects fan
                        speeds that were in the original file, not those fan
                        speed commands added by options in this script
  -t multiplier, --temperature multiplier
                        Multiply all extruder temperatures by this.
  -j degrees, --minimum-temperature degrees
                        Enforce a minimum temperature for all extruder
                        temperature settings (including raft cooling). Will
                        not override extruder off (temp=0) commands.
  -n degrees, --maximum-temperature degrees
                        Enforce a maximum temperature for all extruder
                        temperature settings
  --wait-temp none, first, or all
                        Wait for extruder temperature changes
  --wait-bed-temp none, first, or all
                        Wait for bed temperature changes
  -b multiplier, --bed multiplier
                        Multiply all bed temps by this
  -k degrees layer, --cool-bed degrees layer
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Decrease the bed temperature
                        by DEGREES at specified LAYER
  -q fan_speed, --cool-support fan_speed
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Turns the fan on for all
                        "Support Interface" paths. Fan speed is 0 - 255.
  -g fan_speed, --cool-sparse-infill fan_speed
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Turns the fan on for all
                        "Sparse Infill" paths. Fan speed is 0 - 255.
  -w fan_speed temperaturedrop, --cool-raft fan_speed temperaturedrop
                        Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Adjusts the fan and extrusion
                        temperature to make it easier to remove the raft. Set
                        the fan speed (0-255) and temperature reduction (in
                        degrees) for first object layer
  --filament mm         input file's assumed filament diameter -- for
                        converting linear to volumetric extrusions

Movement control options:
  --quality quality_setting [quality_setting ...]
                        Adjust the print quality for a given key (path / layer
                        / etc. -- only path type is supported at the moment).
                        If supported in printer's firmware, this scales speed,
                        acceleration and jerk values for each extrusion move
                        -- for example 1.0 is normal, 2.0 is half speed and
                        0.5 is double speed. Multiple quality options can be
                        set, with each of the three required settings for each
                        option being comma separated (ie: --quality
                        2,0,path,loop 3.0,path,skirt 0.2,path,perimeter ) .
  -d mm, --decimate mm  Drop XY movements smaller than this. Useful to get rid
                        of excessive "micromoves" that are below the printer's
                        resolution. Requires "--strip" option enabled to work
  --movement abs or rel
                        Convert / output all movement to use absolute or
                        relative mode.
  --extrusion abs or rel
                        Convert / output all extrusion to use absolute or
                        relative mode.
  --scalex x            Scale all X movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  --scaley x            Scale all Y movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  --scalez x            Scale all Z movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  --scaleall x          Scale all X, Y and Z movements by this. Default is 1.0
                        (unchanged)
  -x mm, --xoffset mm   Offset all X movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -y mm, --yoffset mm   Offset all Y movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -z mm, --zoffset mm   Offset all Z movements by this. Use only with absolute
                        coordinate mode.
  -r multiplier, --feedrate multiplier
                        Multiply all movement rates by this (X, Y, Z and
                        Extruder)
  -e multiplier, --extrusion-flow multiplier
                        Multiply extrusion amount by this.
  --precision decimal points
                        Round XYZ movement to the given number of decimal
                        points. Extruder position E and arc definitions I / J
                        are not rounded
  --retract distance speed threshold
                        Retract the filament a given number of mm for non-
                        extrusion moves greater than the threshold (in mm).
                        Retraction speed is in F code feedrate (mm/min)
  --report-move-times   Output the time in comment are for each move
  --report-feedrates    Add comments showing changes to feedrate in mm/s
  --no-spaces           Remove unneed spaces in commands
  --use-G10-G11         Replaces retraction and un-retract gcode with G10 /
                        G11 for printer controlled retraction
  --explicit            Force all coordinates to be listed in all G0/G1/G2/G3
                        commands
  -s, --strip           Strip redundant move command parameters. Saves a
                        little space, should not change the result, in
                        theory... use at your own risk!
  --compress            Strip redundant move command parameters, remove
                        spaces, turn off comments. Makes a smaller file, less
                        human readable, but still valid to the printer.

Printer user interface options:
  -p, --print-layer     Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Print the current layer
                        number on the LCD display
  -v, --verbose         Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Show movement type comments
                        on the LCD display. This command can be risky on some
                        machines because it adds a lot of extra chatter to the
                        user interface and may cause problems during printing.
  -l LCD_COMMAND, --LCD-command LCD_COMMAND
                        Set the G-Code M command for showing a message on the
                        device display. M117 for Marlin, M70 for ReplicatorG
                        (default)
  --progress GCode_header lines
                        Output progress percentage (based on input file lines)
                        every N lines with the given GCode prefix / header
                        (ie: M73 Q). Will not give proper values if you merge
                        or insert or split files in the same pass.
  -c, --colored-movements
                        Cura / Slic3r / KISSlicer only. Set RGB LED to show
                        the path type using the M420 command (Makerbot). This
                        command can be risky on some machines because it adds
                        a lot of extra chatter to the user interface and may
                        cause problems during printing.
  --quote-messages      LCD display commands will wrap quotes around the
                        message

GCode comments options:
  --comments pad or remove
                        Pad or remove comments from gcode file. Pad adds an
                        empty move command to the start of comment only lines.
                        Most hosts will not send comments to printer, however
                        this can cause a line number mismatch between the
                        original file and the printed file (which makes it
                        harder to resume).
  --no-header           Remove the header (all commands before the first layer
                        command)
  -m MOVE_HEADER, --move-header MOVE_HEADER
                        Moves the last X lines (slicing summary) at the end of
                        the file to the head of the file. KISSlicer uses 30
                        lines.
  --description         Add metrics data to the system DESCRIPT.ION file for
                        the output file
  --metrics             Add comments with metrics data to end of the output
                        file
  --report-flow         Add comments to movement showing extrusion vs travel
                        rate (micrometers of filament per mm of travel)
  --keep_pre_resume     Keep movement commands as comments instead of deleting
                        them
  --leave_z_on_resume   Leave the Z height when resume (assume head already at
                        proper Z
