    "this code is intended to modify gcode to work better on a CNC etch a sketch. it'll have 2 purposes:\n",
    "1. linearize all arcs. it'll do this because GRBL seems to throw a lot of arc errors.\n",
    "2. add backlash correction to the code. this is the most important part. the etch a sketch has a lot of internal backlash that can't be corrected. this code will identify when a direction change is made and correct for the backlash of that direction. "
