Surprising cities are attracting new residents, businesses, and investment dollars at the expense of the United States’ most influential real estate markets. It’s a story that Buildium’s up-and-coming markets list has tracked for three years running; and it’s also visible in the Census Bureau’s most recent analysis of domestic migration. On any given day, as Phoenix gained 170 residents, New York City lost 545. Dallas grew by 127 residents each day as Los Angeles shrank by 325. Las Vegas gained 97 new residents per day, and Chicago lost 230.

What’s going on here? You’ve heard the news: The supply of affordable homes simply isn’t keeping up with the demand in primary markets like New York City, San Francisco, and Boston. Long-term residents are being priced out of these expensive markets as lucrative jobs attract an affluent demographic that can afford to pay more for housing.

Where do residents go when they can’t afford their cities anymore? The answer is revealed in this year’s list: Many move to nearby suburbs and satellite cities, which are increasingly developing the transit options and walking-distance attractions that have drawn residents to downtown neighborhoods over the last decade. A smaller portion make the leap to more affordable cities outside of their current metro area.

What differentiates the up-and-coming cities on our list from the rest is a kind of multifaceted growth that doesn’t just happen anywhere. It takes job growth across a range of industries—e.g. technology, manufacturing, and service professions—which benefits a diverse mix of residents and insulates emerging markets from the effects of a recession. It requires a balance between affordability.

Because no place is perfect, we’ve developed a proprietary method of ranking real estate markets based on just about any factor you can measure, pulling from trusted data sources like the Census Bureau to make our evaluations as objective and balanced as possible. All in all, we considered over 100 data points for each of 340 up-and-coming markets to put the health of their real estate markets, local economies, and population growth to the test.

In a time of rapidly changing conditions and compressing cap rates in real estate markets across the U.S., we hope that this year’s list empowers rental owners, property managers, and investors to make the best possible decisions in 2020.

So, here’s how this works: Scan our Tier I and Tier II lists to learn which 50 cities are our best bets for investing in rental property in 2020, as well as 50 more that show the potential to rise up the ranks in the years to come.
